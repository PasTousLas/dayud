# hi dayud!

This extension for the Chrome browser seeks to elimate the common frustration from reading the words 'dad' and 'father' while cumbersomely using your inner monologue to add the proper inflection.

By the magic of javascript all instances of the word 'dad', along with the formal equivalent, are mercifully changed to the melodically countryfied, superbly dignified appellation 'dayud'.

With three settings for immersion level, this chrome extension seeks to seamlessly simplify your online life. 

You're welcome, dayud.
